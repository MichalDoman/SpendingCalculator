# SpendingCalculator

### App purpose:
This is a Django application, that allows the user to save their transactions. It was mainly thought to store house renovation spending. It also enables to filter and sort all the expanses. The app calculates the total amount of spending of currently selected queryset. By default, user can add item's name, price, producer, a room for which the item was purchased and the date of transaction.  

### Future development plans:
In the future I plan to add users, and for each user, the ability to make many documents with different set of transactions. Additionally, make it possible to add custom categories and item characteristics, and make the app suitable for all purposes.
